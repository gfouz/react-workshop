## What is a hash table?
A hash table (often called a hash map) is a data structure that maps
keys to values. Hash tables combine lookup, insert, and delete
operations in an efficient way. The key is sent to a hash function that
performs arithmetic operations on it. The result (called the hash
value or hash) is an index of the key-value pair.
This data structure is widely used in many kinds of computer software,
particularly for associative arrays, database indexing, caches, and
sets. Usually, this operation returns the same hash for a given key.
The performance of a hash table depends on three fundamental factors
hash function, size of the hash table, and collision handling method.

## Hash tables are made up of two parts:
Object: An object with the table where the data is stored. The array holds all the key-value
entries in the table. The size of the array should be set according to the amount of data expected.
Hash function (or mapping function): This function determines the index of our key-value
pair. It should be a one-way function and produce the a different hash for each key.
Note: In JavaScript, hash tables are generally implemented using arrays
as they provide access to elements in constant time.

## Uses of hash tables
Hash tables provide access to elements in constant time, so they are
highly recommended for algorithms that prioritize search and data
retrieval operations. Hashing is ideal for large amounts of data, as
they take a constant amount of time to perform insertion, deletion,
and search. In terms of time complexity, the operation is 0(1). On
average, a hash table lookup is more efficient than other table lookup
data structures.
Some common uses of hash tables are:
Database indexing
Caches
Unique data representation
Lookup in an unsorted array
Lookup in sorted array using binary search

## What is a hash function?
A hash function is a method or function that takes an item’s key as an
input, assigns a specific index to that key and returns the index
whenever the key is looked up. This operation usually returns the same
hash for a given key. A good hash function should be efficient to
compute and uniformly distribute keys. Hash functions help to limit
the range of the keys to the boundaries of the array, so we need a
function that converts a large key into a smaller key. This is the job
of the hash function.

there is much more to talk on this interesting subject 
but i will cover it on a future article.
